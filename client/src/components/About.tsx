          <p>Have you been feeling lately that reading news every morning or even scanning headlines becomes more and more depressing?</p>
          <p>What if you could skip the bad news and read the good ones only?</p>

          <p>Grade_News! app to the rescue. My app is a news reader that classifies information into mood graded categories, allows you decide which ones you want to see and which ones are more likely  make you feel miserable.</p>
